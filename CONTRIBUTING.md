# Contributing to pandemonium

## Requirements

* [Go](https://go.dev) (stable — version from `go.mod`)
* [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
* [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/welcome/install/) (for `just lint`)
* [gremlins](https://github.com/go-gremlins/gremlins) (for mutation testing)

## Development workflow

```
just build      # build the binary
just run        # build and run
just test       # run unit tests
just lint       # golangci-lint
just fmt        # golangci-lint fmt (gofumpt + goimports)
just ci         # lint + test + build
just bench      # run benchmarks
just fuzz       # run fuzz tests
just vulncheck  # govulncheck
just tidy       # go mod tidy
just assets     # regenerate bundled assets
just demos      # regenerate demo assets
just clean      # remove build artifacts
```

Run `just --list` to see every recipe. Run `just ci` (lint + test + build) before each commit. CI runs the same gate on every push to `trunk` and every pull request targeting `trunk`.

## Conventions

The CLI entrypoint and Ebiten GUI structure is shared across the tool family
(unum is the CLI reference; rubix/vivarium the GUI references). See
[CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md).

## Project layout

```
cmd/pandemonium/   entry point
internal/cli/      cobra root + game entrypoint
internal/gui/      Ebiten window + game loop (the only package importing Ebiten)
internal/          implementation packages (render, sim, hud, world, …)
tools/             developer tooling
scripts/           helper scripts
docs/              documentation
```

## Commit style

```
type(scope): short imperative description
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`. No period at the end of the subject line; keep it under 72 characters.

## Releases

Releases are triggered by pushing a semver tag — maintainers only. A GitHub Actions workflow runs GoReleaser to build the binaries and update the Homebrew tap; it requires the tap app credentials configured as repository secrets.
